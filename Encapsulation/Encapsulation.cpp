/*
    DEFINITION : Encapsulations concerns about wrapping Data to hide complexity of a system.
    PURPOSE : Enveloping OR Wrapping the complex Data.
    ACCESS SPECIFIER : The Data under Encapsulation may be Private OR Public.
*/

/*
    1) Encapsulation binds the data & functions together which keeps both safe from outside interference.
    => Data Encapsulation leads to Data Hiding.
    2) In Encapsulation, We have some privaet Data and private Methods which operates on private Data 
        and We have some public Methods also to show the output of private Data & Methods.
    => This private data & methods with public methods makes a capsule in which data is present, so It's called Encapsulation.
    3) Encapsulatin makes the system easier to operate by the end user.   
    NOTE : If we have private Data & Methods but this method don't operate on this data,
            then there is no meaning of Encapsulation and no meaning of OOPs.
