    3) The implementation of Procedure requires number of steps to be perfomed.
    => It is simply contains series of functions which is called again and again, 
        Don't contain data and the functions don't operate on Data, 
        Basically for this no need of OOPs.
    Because OOPs is method for making methods which manipulates the Data.
